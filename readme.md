# Employee Directory
## A smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other.
Using Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use the data to build a prototype for an employee directory.
Request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.
Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
